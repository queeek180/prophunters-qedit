# Prop Hunters - qEdit

This is a fork of [Prop Hunters - Huskle's Edition](https://github.com/zikaeroh/husklesph) which is a fork of [MechanicalMind's Prop Hunters](https://github.com/MechanicalMind/prophunters),
intended to fix a few bugs, add a few features and tweak things to my liking.


## Improvements

For the full list, take a look at the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md), but here is a non-exhaustive list:

- Prop's now tpose by default! - Can by toggled with ph_props_tpose
- Prop's start in thirdperson! - can be toggled with ph_props_thirdperson
- Pre-round, post-round and round timers can all be adjusted with console commands! - More convars to come!!

## Development

Simply edit the lua files with your preferred text editor!
